  "summary": "The heavy dependence on imported equipment, technology, and expertise for green hydrogen production and end-use poses a risk of limiting the economic benefits and job opportunities that could have been generated domestically. Additionally, if investments and policies related to green hydrogen prioritize foreign entities or neglect the inclusion of local communities, it has the potential to worsen existing disparities and hinder poverty reduction efforts. In the case of Africa, green hydrogen production can pose the highest risk (red flag) to the progress towards the target due to poor working conditions and lower gross domestic product/purchasing power parity per capita compared to those of other countries. In general, the ability to manufacture key equipment within the country reduces the risk of various social indicators closely related to this target, such as fair salaries and social security expenditures.|0",
